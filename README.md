<h2>ℹ️ About the project </h2>
This is a project from the Scrimba's <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript">Learn JavaScript for Free</a> course.<br>
It consists in creating an app that is able to, when clicked the respective buttons, add the number of passengers and, when saved, display the entry and go back to 0. <br>
<h2>🧑‍💻 Languages Used </h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h2>✨How The Project Was Created</h2>
Followed along with the course, for the JavaScript writing process, while being given space to try and come up with the solution by self.<br>
With the code given, being able to costumize the project, by:
<ul>
<li>Changing background image.</li>
<li>Changing Font.</li>
<li>Wrap a <code>div</code> around the HTML, and give it a <code>max-width</code>.</li>
<li>Changing the buttons.</li>
</ul>
I also added some small features that were not asked, so the project was more to my personal style.
